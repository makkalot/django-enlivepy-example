Enlivepy
===========

Python port of clojure [enlive library](https://github.com/cgrand/enlive) for html transformation.
It is a simple wrapper over the famous lxml library in Python. When needed, you still can do all
the fun stuff with lxml under the hood. It is not a templating library it is way more powerful than
that :) 


Django Enlive Example
-----------------------

This a simple Django application wich uses Enlivepy as templating solution instead of the Django's default templating engine.
